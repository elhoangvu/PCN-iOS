## Results (on iPhone 6S+)
- iPhone 6S+
- Camera capture preset: 640x480
- Below talbe is a record about PCN benmark on iPhone 6S+ including cases of no face recognition.
| Min face size | Number of faces| Time  | FPS        |
| ------------- |:-------------: | -----:|-----------:|
| 40            | 1              |       |11-14 FPS   |
| 60            | 1              |       |18-27 FPS   |
| 85            | 1              |       |26-37 FPS   |
| 100           | 1              |       |36-60 FPS   |
| 40            | 3              |       |            |
| 60            | 3              |       |            |
| 85            | 3              |       |            |
| 100           | 3              |       |            | 

### Usage

Set minimum size of faces to detect (`size` >= 20)

- `detector.SetMinFaceSize(size);`
  
Set scaling factor of image pyramid (1.4 <= `factor` <= 1.6)
  
- `detector.SetImagePyramidScaleFactor(factor);`
  
Set score threshold of detected faces (0 <= `thresh1`, `thresh2`, `thresh3` <= 1)
  
- `detector.SetScoreThresh(thresh1, thresh2, thresh3);`

Smooth the face boxes or not (smooth = true or false, recommend using it on video to get stabler face boxes)
  
- `detector.SetVideoSmooth(smooth);`

## Note
##### You can replace caffe-ios by another caffe-ios implementation to reduce speed, performance, stability,...
##### The current caffe-ios lib is used with CPU_ONLY mode only because iOS platform don't support CUDA. 

## Issues
- High failed rate for face detection
- Current caffe version uses a lot of system resources
