### Usage

Set minimum size of faces to detect (`size` >= 20)

- `detector.SetMinFaceSize(size);`
  
Set scaling factor of image pyramid (1.4 <= `factor` <= 1.6)
  
- `detector.SetImagePyramidScaleFactor(factor);`
  
Set score threshold of detected faces (0 <= `thresh1`, `thresh2`, `thresh3` <= 1)
  
- `detector.SetScoreThresh(thresh1, thresh2, thresh3);`

Smooth the face boxes or not (smooth = true or false, recommend using it on video to get stabler face boxes)
  
- `detector.SetVideoSmooth(smooth);`

See [picture.cpp](picture.cpp) and [video.cpp](video.cpp) for details. If you want to reproduce the results on FDDB, please run [fddb.cpp](fddb.cpp). You can rotate the images in FDDB to get FDDB-left, FDDB-right, and FDDB-down, then test PCN on them respectively. 

## Note
##### You can replace caffe-ios by another caffe-ios implementation to reduce speed, performance, stability,...
##### The current caffe-ios lib is used with CPU_ONLY mode only because iOS platform don't support CUDA. 

## Issues
- Some faces are difficult to detect.
